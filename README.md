# Spark Examples within Databricks [Current Version 2.4.0]
 
I have found that Databricks Notebooks and their HTML exports with cell output combined with GitHub Pages provides a clean way to show examples not just for Spark, but for any Python or Scala code.

So below are a few sections of examples/demonstrations of, mostly Spark, concepts I found interesting or felt like I should record somewhere

These examples started out with Spark 2.4.0, as more versions release I will attempt to keep these updated. I will also branch off if anything major must change. For now 2.4.0 will be held in master.
